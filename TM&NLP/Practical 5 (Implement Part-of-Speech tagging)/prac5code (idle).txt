Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language.
It involves tasks such as speech recognition, text classification, machine translation, sentiment analysis, and more.
NLP has applications in various industries including healthcare, finance, entertainment, and customer service.
The rapid development of NLP models such as transformers has revolutionized the field, enabling machines to understand and generate human language at scale.
